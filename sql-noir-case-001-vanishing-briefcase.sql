--I wanted to try and figure this out using JOIN 


-- this did not work:
SELECT * 
FROM interviews 
JOIN suspect ON interviews.suspect_id = suspects.id 
AND scar = 'left cheek' 
AND attire = 'trench coat';

-- this didn't work either: 
SELECT * 
FROM interviews 
JOIN suspects ON interviews.suspect_id = suspects.id 
AND scar = 'left cheek' 
AND attire = 'trench coat';


--finally found the issue: 

SELECT * 
FROM interviews 
JOIN suspects ON interviews.suspect_id = suspects.id 
WHERE transcript IS NOT NULL 
AND scar = 'left cheek' 
AND attire = 'trench coat';

Answer: 
suspect_id	transcript	id	name	attire	scar
183	I wasnâ€™t going to steal it, but I did.	183	Vincent Malone	trench coat	left cheek
